# RTEnnui

RTEnnui is a replacement for the media component of WebRTC. Its goals are
portability, low latency, and control.

WebRTC's support for client-to-client data connections is good, but its media
support suffers from design by committee. It's extremely opaque, has
unpredictable latency and performance, and has requirements that are quite
onerous in terms of patents.

RTEnnui is currently very much in development, and not yet ready for public
consumption.
